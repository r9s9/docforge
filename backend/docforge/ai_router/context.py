"""What the generation AI is told about the *document* it is filling.

Routing used to see a flat list of fields — name, type, description — with no
idea which part of the document each one belonged to, what came before it, or
what the section it sits in is for. That is the difference between filling in a
form and writing a document, and it is why generated content could be perfectly
valid per field yet read wrong in place.

All of the missing signal already exists: analysis records a
:class:`SectionUnderstanding` per section (its purpose and the content expected
there) and the representative document keeps the original element order. This
module assembles both into a compact payload the prompts can carry.

Templates published before fields carried a ``section_key`` are handled too:
:func:`resolve_section_keys` reconstructs the grouping at generation time, so
old templates get the benefit without being republished.
